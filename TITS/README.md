TITS
================

## What is TITS? ##
TITS is a recursive acronym that stands for 'TITS Is a Tictactoe Solver'.
It's a sort of Artificial Intelligence, which works generating a tree of all possible scenarios, and chooses the best path according to some criteria (win statistics, lose statistics). This is possible thanks to the limited size of the assigned problem.
